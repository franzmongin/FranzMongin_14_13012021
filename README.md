# HRNET REACT

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project is a conversion of HRNET which was using JQuery into a new app using React.
The jquery plugins who used JQuery were converted into native JS, only the Datatable plugin was converted into a react component and published on npm:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/datatable_table_react_test
